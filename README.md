# Url-Shortener

This application was built with react, the styling was done solely with styled components. Also I was able to make use of the react hook - useEffect.
This hook helps in handling any side effects that would have arose as a result of importing data from an API.
Also once the links are shortened, the user has the ability to copy the shortened version to their clipboard.
